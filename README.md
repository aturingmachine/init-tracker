# Init-Tracker

This is a simple Single Page Application used to track initiative in Dungeons and Dragons games. Combatants can be added to the list allowing you to track their:

- Name
- Initiative
- Armor Class
- Spell Save DC
- Passive Perceptions
- Conditions

Combatants marked as a Player Character will be saved to your browsers localStorage and reloaded back into the appliction on startup so they do not need to be re-entered. Player characters are saved on addition and automatically every 2 minutes.
